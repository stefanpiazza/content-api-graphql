        "body": "[dropcap]V[/dropcap]isiting in 1953, John Steinbeck enthused: 'Positano bites deep. It is a dream place that isn't quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone.' Today, it is no less enchanting. Lying an hour and a quarter south of Naples, the drive to Positano takes you past Pompeii and Mount Vesuvius, past Sorrento and then along the mountain coastline until the vertiginous descent to the town begins. \r\n\r\nSeen from below, the buildings seem to have been stacked one on top of another, climbing from the tiny crescent bay towards the cliffs that loom precipitously over the town. The pastel colours - primrose, pink, terracotta, peach and white - give the town a theatrical aspect that couldn't be mistaken for anywhere else. In the mid-1950s Positano became desirable as a holiday destination and, for a while, rivalled Capri as the playground for the rich and famous. Patricia Highsmith based the little port of Mongibello in [i]The Talented Mr Ripley[/i] on Positano, although Anthony Minghella chose to film that part of his adaptation in [i]Ischia[/i]. A low-wattage celebrity still glimmers here and there and, with world-class restaurants and ultra-luxe hotels, the town still attracts a glamorous, affluent crowd.\r\n\r\n[h2]Where to stay in Positano[/h2]\r\n\r\n[image id=\"WveRqEQL2j5\"]\r\n\r\n[h3]LE SIRENUSE[/h3]\r\n\r\n[button url=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100l4voT/destination:https://www.expedia.co.uk/Amalfi-Coast-Hotels-Le-Sirenuse.h12066.Hotel-Information?siteid=100704\"]Check your dates at Le Sirenuse on Expedia now[/button]\r\n\r\nThe world-famous Sirenuse is a patrician house which has been turned into a family-run hotel. It takes its name from the islands of the Sirens which it overlooks. It has a feeling of comfortable, lived-in elegance, with a beautiful majolica-covered third-floor terrace and small swimming pool. It also boasts one of the best fish restaurants in town: La Sponda and an exceptionally cool spa.

The view from the terrace surveys an expanse of vivid turquoise sea on one side and the stacked slopes of Positano on the other. From this vantage point the town looks particularly beautiful. A lift plunges down to reception, beyond which is a wide, hibiscus-strewn terrace. The rooms - each with private terrace and almost all with Jacuzzi - spill down the hillside, and are connected by a warren of stairways. A second lift emerges at the private beach, bar and tennis court. Open from April to November. \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\r\n[i]Via Laurito 2 (00 39 089 875 455, [link url=\"http://www.ilsanpietro.it/en/index.php\"]ilsanpietro.it[/link]).[/i]\r\n\r\n[h3]HOTEL PALAZZO MURAT[/h3]\r\nDown towards the beach, the Palazzo Murat has no view to speak of, but with its 18th-century charm and plant-strewn courtyard it is a magnet for a high-spending clientele. Open April to October and over Christmas/New Year. \u00a3\u00a3\r\n[i]Via dei Mulini 23 (00 39 089 875 177, [link url=\"https://www.palazzomurat.it/\"]palazzomurat.it[/link]).[/i]\r\n\r\n[h3]HOTEL POSEIDON[/h3]\r\nThe Hotel Poseidon Positano is a beautiful villa surrounded by luscious gardens. The philosophy of the hotel is to offer a discreet and refined hospitability, in harmony with the image and tradition of Positano. The original idea was to build a small intimate villa for the owners to spend their holidays. However, inspired by their love for Positano and their entrepreneur spirit, the family transformed the villa into a small hotel with 48 rooms and two suites. \u00a3\u00a3\r\n[i]Via Pastia 148 (00 39 089 811 111; [link url=\"https://www.hotelposeidonpositano.it/\"]hotelposeidonpositano.it[/link]).\r\n[/i]\r\n\r\n[image id=\"MA2p7ko6rnL\"]\r\n\r\n[h2]Where to eat out in Positano[/h2]\r\n\r\n[h3]BUCA DI BACCO[/h3]\r\nThis is the harbour front's main caf\u00e9 and a Positano institution. Sip a Prosecco in the shade of the front's main caf\u00e9, the Buca di Bacco, and watch passenger ferries stopping by to gawp on their way to Capri.\r\n[i]Via Rampa Teglia 4 (00 39 089 875 699, [link url=\"http://www.bucadibacco.it/restaurant.asp\"]bucadibacco.it[/link]).[/i]\r\n\r\n[h3]RESTAURANT AL PALAZZO AT HOTEL PALAZZO MURAT[/h3]\r\nCreative Mediterranean cuisine served al fresco in the beautiful botanic gardens of the hotel. \r\n[i]Via dei Mulini 23 (00 39 089 875 177, [link url=\"http://www.palazzomurat.it/restaurant-positano/\"]palazzomurat.it[/link]).[/i] \r\n\r\n[h3]DONNA ROSA[/h3]\r\nJust above Positano, this family-run restaurant serves delicious country food and fantastic home-made pasta, and has live music. \r\n[i]Via Montepertuso 97-99 (00 39 089 811 806, [link url=\"http://www.drpositano.com/\"]drpositano.com[/link]).[/i]\r\n\r\n[image id=\"2kV6oQ5XkQB\"]\r\n\r\n[h3]DON ALFONSO 1890[/h3]\r\nRegional Med cuisine, modern cooking techniques and organic ingredients from the restaurant's own farm.

These are mainly beachwear and holiday T-shirts. One or two trendy boutiques hide away on back streets, but there are none of the covetable names you will find on the main square in Portofino.\r\n\r\n[image id=\"0y9970z78wJ\"]\r\n\r\n[h3]DAY TRIPS[/h3]\r\n\r\n[h4]MONTEPERTUSO[/h4]\r\nIf you have time, take a trip up to Montepertuso, a village perched 3km above Positano. The next town east along the drive from Positano, Praiano, could be Positano's little sister, with a similar beach and church, but not quite as charming as its neighbour. After Praiano, keep an eye out for the most impressive natural feature along the drive, the steep, impenetrable Furore Gorge.\r\n\r\nSee our guide to the [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/article/travel-guide-amalfi-coast\"]Amalfi Coast[/link] for more.\r\n\r\n[image id=\"nY0XP1824WZ\"]\r\n\r\n[h2]How to get to Positano[/h2]\r\n\r\n[h3]AIRPORT[/h3]\r\n\r\nThe nearest international airport is at Naples, from which it is about one hour 15 minutes drive to Positano.\r\n\r\n[h3]AIRLINES FROM THE UK[/h3]\r\n\r\n[b]British Airways[/b] (0870 8509 850; [link url=\"https://www.britishairways.com/travel/home/public/en_ie\"]ba.com[/link]) flies direct twice daily from Gatwick to Naples. [b]easyJet[/b] (08717 500 100; [link url=\"https://www.easyjet.com/\"]easyjet.com[/link]) flies daily from Stansted to Naples.\r\n\r\n[h3]TRAIN AND BUS[/h3]\r\n\r\nTake a [b]Circumvesuviana[/b] train from the station on [b]Corso Garibaldi[/b] in Naples. It runs about every 20 minutes, takes one hour and 10 minutes to Sorrento and costs about \u20ac5. Once there, catch a blue [b]CITA[/b] bus to Positano from right outside the train station. It runs about once an hour and costs about \u20ac1.50. A word of warning: the roads are very twisty so those with weak stomachs should elbow their way into the front seats to stave off nausea.\r\n\r\n[h3]FERRY[/h3]\r\n\r\nThe [b]Metro del Mare[/b] runs from about April to October. Check [link url=\"http://www.metrodelmare.com/\"]metrodelmare.com[/link] for further information. When the weather is cooperating, this is by far the nicest and quickest (about 40 minutes) way to get from Naples to Positano. \r\n\r\n[h3]CAR SERVICE[/h3]\r\n\r\nMany hotels in Positano offer their own airport- collection service for guests (for a fee) and the journey takes about one hour 15 minutes. If you wish to book your own car and driver, Le Sirenuse hotel recommends the [b]Positano Car Service[/b] (00 39 089 875 541) which costs \u20ac100 each way.\r\n\r\n[h3]CAR RENTAL[/h3]\r\n\r\n[b]Avis Rent A Car[/b] hires cars from \u20ac191 per week (0870 606 0100; [link url=\"https://www.avis.com/en/home\"]www.avis.com[/link]). [b]Hertz[/b] hires cars from \u20ac212 per week (0870 846 0007; [link url=\"http://www.hertz.co.uk/\"]hertz.co.uk[/link]).",

                "description": "[h3]Homespun seafood champ in Highbury[/h3]\n\nUntil now, Drayton Park has been blissfully untouched by the spiralised twists and turnips of foodie fads, but contented itself with something sliced off a rotating skewer from the sort of outfit even Chicken Connoisseur would pass by without a glance. It's an unreconstructed spot in Highbury, and the area's most famous address is a little place called the Emirates Stadium; but North London flavour-snufflers and fellow chefs have been getting excited about Westerns Laundry, the second fixture for the team behind [link url=\"http://www.cntraveller.com/recommended/food/secret-restaurants-east-london\"]Primeur[/link]. Primeur opened in 2015 on a tree-lined boulevard in Newington Green, and quickly became a local hero for its French-peasant small plates and low-intervention wines, all sourced and presented with a [i]Kinfolk[/i]-style attention to detail. Co-founders Jeremie Cometto-Lingenheim and chef David Gingell have a bundle of experience (Galvin, Hix, Wright Brothers), basically, and Westerns Laundry has hit the ground running. The restaurant is a gallery-like space in a Fifties industrial block, opened up with steel-framed windows, cobbles and Jeremie-crafted benches outside; the long and vociferous communal tables inside illuminated by Dan Flavin-style neon dashes.\n\n[h3]FOOD[/h3]\n\nUnlike Primeur, the inspiration at Westerns Laundry are the day boats that heave to around the Cornish coast, with occasional forays to Catalunya and [link url=\"http://www.cntraveller.com/guides/asia\"]Asia[/link] for spicing. Plates arrive in an irregular succession: a half-dozen Morecambe Bay oysters; panko-crusted fingers of cuttlefish and ham on a cushion of deeply dippy aioli; nicely flaky salt cod with peppers; chargrilled flat beans topped with creamy curd; a Japanese-style turbot fortified with miso and ginger. But the plate you need to order above anything else is the baked lobster pasta - vermicelli noodles in a rich stock with chunks of crustacean that's quite as good as the lobster mac'n'cheese at [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-bars-london#rPqN8qvE85y\"]Hawksmoor[/link]. Dishes aren't enormous, so there's doubtless room for the rum baba to share, an ample, sultana-pocked wodge of deliciousness. A special mention, too, for the funky Seventies-style earthenware, wood-fired in Ohio and Bristol (Jeremie's an amateur potter and was keen to source something that reflected Primeur's hand-hewn spirit. If there was a log fire, he'd be swinging an axe).\n\n[h3]DRINK[/h3]\n\nThe chalkboard has a dynamic roll call of biodynamic wines by the glass, from pockets of Italy, France, Austria and Greece, ripe with Carignan, Zweigelt and Cinsault grapes - but nothing too weird and all scout-mastered by Francis Roberts, who can also bring over the leather-bound spell book of serious bottles. By the glass, start with a rich, yeasty Alsace cr\u00e9mant, then maybe a flinty Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire, and an intense Grenache blend from Roussillon. There's also Belgian beer and a short list of vermouths and digestifs.\n\n[h3]THE VERDICT[/h3]\n\nA convivial neighbourhood restaurant that's opening up a neglected part of London.

I first came to what was then Yugoslavia in the late 1980s, stumbling off the train in Zagreb, travelling by bus to the coast to have my sleeves plucked by short grandmothers in crow-black cowls who offered bedrooms for a fiver, waking after midday to force down grainy, hours-cold coffee. After the conflict I went back, first to [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/dubrovnik\"]Dubrovnik[/link], eating fried sardines beneath the city walls with fishermen pleased to see visitors returning, then hopping between Korc\u02c7ula, Hvar and Vis, and the scattershot islands around them \u2013 the dots that inspired the Romans to christen spotted hunting dogs as Dalmatians. I hiked poppy-lit tracks to cliff-top churches, watched lightning storms crackle out at sea. But more recently, I\u2019ve been drawn north to Rovinj, a coastal citadel that\u2019s nobody\u2019s secret, really, but seems off-radar to those who gravitate to overcrowded Dubrovnik; slip away by boat or bicycle and you can have a cove to yourself, even in [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/where-to-go-on-holiday-in-august\"]August[/link], and in [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/leaf-peeping-in-autumn\"]autumn[/link] it\u2019s still warm enough to leap straight off a rock into the sea. \r\n\r\nRovinj is in Istria, the peninsula that dangles like a bunch of grapes at the top of the Adriatic opposite [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/venice\"]Venice[/link], once the dominant power here.  Then came Napoleon and the Ottomans,  and the region paused for breath as part of [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/italy\"]Italy[/link] between the wars before being absorbed into Yugoslavia. Habsburg families would holiday along the Istrian Riviera, taking the waters from stucco villas the colour of faded cotton. Istrian ladies would board the steam boat for Trieste in time for the opera. Now post-[link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/ibiza\"]Ibiza[/link] parties have colonised the southern town of Pula, setting up sound-systems in air-raid tunnels dug during World War I. And while Ast\u00e9rix would feel at home in the oaky-folky hinterland, with its wild boar, farm signs for donkey milk and cart wheels, a succession of discreet, well-designed wine estates, [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/topic/hotels\"]hotels[/link] and [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/topic/villas\"]villas[/link] are appearing \u2013 a marked change from the days when grand fa\u00e7ades hid fly-blown Seventies interiors \u2013 and the region\u2019s small-batch food and low-intervention wine (oh, the wine) is gaining a reputation to match [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/tuscany\"]Tuscany[/link]\u2019s.\r\n\r\n[image id=\"7Oqj0OgZ6v1\"]\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a routine to any first day back in Rovinj. Walk around the harbour past fishing nets and the knitting-needle click of masts on one side, the old tobacco chimneys on the other, for a drink outside the Hotel Adriatic. Then climb shellac-smooth steps through the old town, past the iron-booted diving suit at Veli Jo\u017ee restaurant, up to the church plateau for a crow\u2019s-nest sighting of the Adriatic, the statue of St Euphemia high above set on ball-bearings so she turns with the wind. In the tangle of medieval alleys, some end abruptly with the waves. Swifts scream overhead like Imperial fighters defending the Death Star. Many families, with memories that go back 600 years, have sold up, swapping crumbling garrets for brighter homes further out, but there are still semaphores of laundry strung between apartments. The town cobbler holds fast, a box frame outside like a shrine with wooden lasts and two-tone leather; wilting photographs show smiling men with aprons and cigarettes, squinting in sepia sunshine. There will always be time for Prosecco and scallops and sea truffles at Puntulina, cradled in the rocks where smugglers landed fish in Venetian times and where local youth jump in, brown limbs kicking up flurries of dazzled water, like a scene from an early Fellini film. Sometimes I\u2019ll see dolphins loping into a blood-orange sunset \u2013 it feels like the restaurant at the end of the universe.\r\n\r\n[image id=\"meKwzedXgJV\"]\r\n\r\n\u2018Four years ago, there was a mighty storm that sent waves crashing right over us, whoosh!\u2019 says Giovanni Pellizzer, generations of fishermen behind him, who runs Puntulina like a boat\u2019s skipper. \u2018Afterwards we found sea sponges on the roof.\u2019 His father Corrado is the godfather of Rovinj nightlife; after visiting [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/milan\"]Milan[/link] in the 1960s, he opened the first disco in Yugoslavia here, then its first pizzeria. The club closed down, bizarrely accused of playing fascist music, but his restaurants survive. \u2018My father\u2019s 81 but when he\u2019s with his friends at the Rio caf\u00e9, drinking and telling stories, he\u2019s still in his 20s.\u2019 At the Grota bar in the market, men the same generation gather like Scorsese wiseguys, T-shirts straining, trading well-trodden jokes in Rovinj-Italian around the upturned barrels, sometimes snapping hands out for a round of [i]morra[/i], the millennia-old guessing game. Marietta, body like a ballerina, pirouettes around with the mid-morning wine, the bar\u2019s own vintage, and carries glasses of fizzy, herbaceous Pasareta, the colour of neon coral, to the fishmongers who stand over rock-skinned scorpion fish, mouths gaping like surprised gargoyles, ready for the bouillabaisse pot.\r\n\r\n[pullquote]Here in Istria, there is clarity. Of light and water, of stone and birdsong.[/pullquote]\r\n\r\nSlipping into the water off Mulini [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/topic/beaches\"]beach[/link] and its modernist white promenade, you swim back only to sink calf-deep in pebbles, laughing and flailing around, falling on your knees to wade out. Just around the headland is one of my favourite places, a derelict beach club that\u2019s slowly been zombified, creepers and roots taking over the graffitied [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/amazing-swimming-pools\"]swimming pools[/link]. Look on my ping-pong tables, ye mighty, and despair. Further along the coast the beaches get wilder and more naked. Locals will head to the nearby islands to swim, or over to little coves such as the one at Brsec\u02c7, or Premantura on the southern tip, to dive from high on the cliffs. Istria is flinty hard, karst country, with limestone bones that knuckle through the surface, cushioned by red earth that scars easily. On the geological record, its time as part of Yugoslavia is just a scattering of dust.  \r\n\r\n[image id=\"RRpaXRxdyN1\"]\r\n\r\nFrom the 1950s, the Istrian [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/topic/islands\"]islands[/link] were designated as the people\u2019s paradise by Tito \u2013 war hero, Stalin-defier, and a man with an almost Tudor appetite for exotic beasts \u2013 who had his summer home in the Brijuni cluster, driving his Lincoln Convertible around and feeding the elephants given to him by Indira Gandhi. His [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/topic/wildlife\"]wildlife[/link] park survives, with one solitary tusker and a forlornly surreal atmosphere. Get the angles right and you can line up grazing zebra with Roman ruins and empty beaches. In the gallery are acres of photographs of the man, a homage to wide-lapel beige suits and the stars of the day. He was modest enough to request Richard Burton to play him in a film, hosting the actor on his yacht the [i]Galeb[/i], which is soon to be turned into a museum. Burton, strangely sober and bored by the endless translated anecdotes, Taylor basking in the perceived power of it all, waving at sunbathers on the rocks \u2013 Tito proudly telling his captive audience that the caves beneath are infested with gunboats and submarines.\r\n\r\n[pullquote]Many families here have memories that go back 600 years.[/pullquote]\r\n\r\nThere are Ottoman ruins in the woods outside Meneghetti wine estate, near Bale, and old army camps with artillery shells set as a warning on concrete posts. On a pebble beach here the only other person is a grizzled man who rubs his stubble and tells me he once played folk guitar for Tito. But at Meneghetti it\u2019s all about the here and the now and the Merlot and food: oysters from the Lim fjord, goat\u2019s cheese and prosciutto, orzo stained black with cuttlefish, beetroot and chocolate [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-ice-cream-in-london\"]ice cream[/link]. Eating never used to be this good in [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/croatia\"]Croatia[/link]. Olive oil so fresh it kicks like a grasshopper; white Malvazija wine, floral and light. I stumble across a trio of young chefs who have set up ranch outside Rovinj, bringing intricate seafood plates to painted tables beneath olive trees as the light ripens and fades. In country [i]konobas[/i], the family-run taverns, strong-armed matriarchs stir pencil shavings of earthy black truffle into creamy pasta, and serve mushrooms gathered in the forest that morning. A challenge would be to go a day without eating truffle in some form. I try it once, only to be ambushed by a tapenade of olive and truffle, unannounced on the menu. \r\n\r\n[image id=\"oBj1nB22xQ6\"]\r\n\r\nThose truffles come from Istria\u2019s interior, from around medieval villages that delight in names such as Hum and Vrh. Many exist in various states of abandonment and rediscovery; left to crumble after World War II. Groz\u02c7njan, for example, is heartbreakingly pretty, with its painted shutters and absence of 21st-century trappings, but, transformed into an art colony in the 1960s, is now over-run with wind chimes and figurines, garish oil paintings of the sort that decorate coffee shops. But in Oprtalj, the church bell scattered birds above an empty square, and Escher-like steps seem to lead nowhere. A solitary figure with the beard and gauntness of a dissident poet sits on a bench selling local wine. I find a single atelier open, owned by a Dutch emigr\u00e9, Minke van Ingen, who knits life-like birds, sets flowers in resin and has a Martin Parr-like eye for the everyday absurd. She counts on her fingers and tells me that just 55 people live here, many of the buildings were restored as foster homes for orphans from the Bosnian conflict. But many are still roofless shells, beautiful ruins with hollow-eyed windows, an eerie Wild East ghost town.   \r\n\r\n[pullquote]Local youth jump in, brown limbs kicking up flurries of dazzled water, like a scene from an early Fellini film [/pullquote]\r\n\r\nFolklore still skulks and snaps twigs in the dense greensward. Libidinous blood-drinkers, or [i]vukodlaci[/i], nocturnal demons and vampire-hunting shaman make for a Balkan Gothic untapped by popular culture. The first recorded story of a vampire comes from the hamlet of Kringa, and a 17th-century figure who kept rising from the dead until neighbours drove a stake through his heart. Beneath the soft waves off Rovinj lies a drowned village known as Cissa, the Istrian Atlantis, and fishermen claim their nets occasionally snare amphora or bricks. But vampires, really? My friend Vanja, who has lived here since she was a girl, smiles a smile and twiddles the red bracelet she wears to ward off witches.\r\n\r\n[image id=\"a3OX63yvpo6\"]\r\n\r\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap]n Motovun, grass grows between rippling cobbles; long-shut iron gates guard untended wilderness. A van trundles around, its female Tannoy voice repeating \u2018fresh fish, fresh fish\u2019 over brass-band horns. On caf\u00e9 radios, hoarse-throated crooners sing of love and loss over plinky-plonk rhythms \u2013 Tom Waits meets Eurovision. I side-step off the street and follow a back path braced by vines, down to a cemetery guarded by a cortege of slender-hipped cypresses, stones decorated with the Catholic kitsch of plastic flowers and cupids, Luigis next to Draganovics. It\u2019s a languorous cat-stretch of a day. Geckos slip in and out of stone walls like tongues. At the top of the village are battlements where you can lean on fossil-dry bulwarks and trace the line of the canal that threads into Slovenia, the valley breeze buffing your face.\r\n\r\n[pullquote]I\u2019ve been drawn north to Rovinj, a coastal citadel that\u2019s nobody\u2019s secret, really, but seems off-radar [/pullquote]\r\n\r\nCompared to Oprtalj, Motovun is a megacity of almost 550 people. I find 10 of them gathered in the church one evening, male voices joined in acappella; a Croatian klapa choir. Singing has deep roots in Istria; instead of sea shanties, fishermen sang [i]aria da nuoto[/i], passing notes wordlessly from boat to boat. William, a towering presence and the local curtain-maker, stands alongside the mayor and a man with badger-hair mohawk; the choir master is the cousin of a cousin of someone else and the voices rise, va-va-va-va, as warm as freshly waxed oak, up towards fleshy baroque angels. Outside, a lone red Fiat, filled with laughing, dark-haired students, rattles down a squeeze-gut street, scrapes its axle and disappears round a bend.\r\n\r\n[image id=\"pJmLxJVWYR6\"]\r\n\r\nI head back to my friends at Villa Angelo, an 18th-century former customs house with a nose-less stone face above the door lintel, which has been tamed by a thirtysomething English landscape gardener, Ben Wilson, as a place to rent. The floors are laid with stippled local marble from the same quarry that helped build Venice and the White House. There\u2019s a wooden chemist\u2019s counter from Italy, sketches of the Ch\u00e2teau de Clavary and its Picasso mosaic, which once belonged to the family, and a terrace with a rain-polished farmhouse table, arched windows framing needlework rows of vines, the coarse green wool of woodland. Right beneath is a delicious strip of swimming pool \u2013 the only one in Motovun, wrestled out of the hard ground \u2013 and a garden hazy-impressionist with lavender and rosemary, a cave-like steam room tucked inside dry-stone walls the colour of crema Catalana.\r\n\r\n\r\n[pullquote]Slip away by boat or bicycle and you can have a cove to yourself[/pullquote]\r\n\r\nBen\u2019s father Philip wears braces on his trousers decorated with skulls, has a sparkle in his eye, and offers to show us his collection of outlandish gourds. A retired publisher, whose own father ran Sotheby\u2019s after the war, he bought a house in Motovun in the late 1970s when a book on medieval medical instruments became an unlikely hit in Yugoslavia.  We\u2019re closer here to more UNESCO sites than [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/berlin\"]Berlin[/link] or [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/paris\"]Paris[/link], he declares from the terrace. And that large house over on the hillside there, he points, belongs to one of the last of the Habsburgs. Over there, a descendant of Bismarck. These folds of half-forgotten valleys are where old empires go to ground. English eccentrics, too, and an [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/location/los-angeles\"]LA[/link] video director, a neighbour, who eloped here from the madness to make his own music and throttles around villages and wild-swimming waterholes on his motorbike. He joins us for a feast on the terrace, Nick Cave hair and Byron white shirt, where chef Sasha brings king-prawn risotto and red mullet, sleeves rolled up, shaking his head sadly at our request for no meat and talking about life in the Balkans. \u2018Albania?\u2019 he shrugs, \u2018I would never return but,\u2019 his eyes light up, \u2018they make Cognac better than the French.\u2019 Istrians can be a little disparaging about Dalmatia and its art of [i]fjaka[/i], the sweetness of doing nothing \u2013 or as I\u2019m told by Vanja, \u2018when the sun gets up, it\u2019s time for them to lie down\u2019.  \r\n\r\n[image id=\"DybgXykb2AJ\"]\r\n\r\nThe feast turns into a pool party, blurs of pale inked skin breaking the water\u2019s surface as lightning veins the darkness. Above, clear skies swirl with million-year-old star-shine: this elevated hill village is an accidental observatory. It seems in the middle of nowhere, but feels more connected to the rest of the galaxy than any [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/topic/city-breaks\"]city[/link]. The next morning, there is a noise outside the shutters that ebbs then gathers fresh mom-entum. It\u2019s a resonant brightness of feathery static, a glitterball burst of birdsong that seems to oscillate on the same frequency as the sun. As the light saturates the room, so does the sound of swifts and swallows. Here in Istria, there is clarity. Of light and water, of stone and birdsong.\r\n\r\n[i]Keep scrolling to see more pictures of Istria, Croatia[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Like this?

Well, that\u2019s how the owners of the hotel chain are pitching Double Standard, which occupies half of the ground floor of the space, with a cosy little [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/outdoor-drinking-london\"]terrace[/link] out back away from the fray. But to call it a pub would just be plain wrong; it\u2019s most definitely a bar \u2013 the second longest one in London, the brand claims \u2013 and feels a bit like stepping back into the 1970s. The Brutalist pillars of the former Camden Council building are complemented by the immersive retro interiors: squashy red-leather banquette seating; polished wood; velour seats; brown [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/beautiful-patterned-tiles-around-the-world\"]tiles[/link]; and net curtains, perfect for twitching. In fact, the whole place is great for people-watching \u2013 an evening could easily be spent wondering which guest is a famous music producer. A disco soundtrack gives it a strong party-spot vibe. If it all gets a bit much, retire next door for a strong nightcap in the library lounge, and relax on a low sofa while perusing an eclectic and tongue-in-cheek selection of ex-library books.\r\n\r\n[image id=\"6oa632drJz5\"]\r\n\r\n[h3]DRINKS[/h3]\r\nThe [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/the-future-of-cocktails\"]cocktails[/link] here are classics with a knowing British twist: a G&Tea, a Chocolate Stout Martini and a Cider Spritz. There\u2019s even an Earl Grey tea punch, just to remind visitors that they\u2019re in London. They\u2019re fun party cocktails to match the disco vibe, if a little too consistently sweet and fruity. This being a pub, there\u2019s also Heineken and Guinness on tap, and several crafty options in the fridge. There\u2019s a slightly different, more traditional menu in the library lounge next door including a wide whisky selection.\r\n\r\n[h3]BAR SNACKS[/h3]\r\nEx-Pachamama chef Adam Rawson has come up with a menu that mixes classic American and British comfort foods. The snacks section is the best: there\u2019s a big pretzel with house mustard and parmesan, goujon-like fried chicken with aioli, and a herby Scotch egg with fennel tartare and dill mustard. There are also larger posh-pub plates such as burgers, fish and chips and mac and cheese. With this many carbs on offer, you won\u2019t need to worry about lining your stomach.\r\n\r\n[image id=\"4arPKE8v01n\"]\r\n\r\n[h3]VERDICT[/h3]\r\nIt calls itself a [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/article/best-craft-ale-pubs-in-london\"]pub[/link], but it\u2019s more the kind of Seventies California-style bar last seen in the final season of Mad Men. Which is more than all right by us.

Drinks \u2013 served in giant seashells, a hot air balloon, or even a Chinese takeaway carton \u2013 came with golf balls as ice cubes, a set of dentures as a garnish or a portion of chips as a bizarre topping. Founders Andy Mil, Olly Brading and Elliot Ball quickly racked up a string of awards for their no-limits ingenuity, and now the boys have opened a second venture \u2013 a gritty, gangster-themed drinking den in a dark and moody basement on a Fitzrovia backstreet. And although the place takes its cocktails seriously, the earnestness stops there. Donald Trump greets guests at the door (in the form of a life-size, grinning photograph, with \u2018Old Douche Lane\u2019 emblazoned across his chest\u2026); inside, walls are lined with tongue-in-cheek, black-and-white photographs of hustlers and bad boys. Some of the decor is downright random (look out for the signed picture of Charlie Sheen in the loos), but the exposed brickwork and red neon lights give the place a sultry New York [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/secret-bars-in-london\"]speakeasy[/link] feel. There\u2019s live music some nights of the week too \u2013 but it\u2019s a tiny space, so get here early if you want a seat.\n\n[h3]DRINKS[/h3]\nThere\u2019s less smoke and mirrors here than at Murder Inc\u2019s [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/shoreditch-things-to-do\"]Shoreditch[/link] sister, but that\u2019s not to say drinks aren\u2019t still served with a smack of theatricality. Expect all kinds of curious syrups, sherbets and garnishes (including walnut masala, tarte tatin sherbet and tonka bean egg yolk) \u2013 but start with the signature cocktail, Death in the Afternoon. It\u2019s served on tap, a Listerine-blue, souped-up (and infinitely more delicious) version of Hemingway\u2019s original, sweetened with a dash of ginger and agave syrup. Twists on the classics are the main theme \u2013 like the Long Irn Iced Tea, a hot mess of a drink topped up with Scotland\u2019s favourite fizz, and the punny Hench 75, made with Plymouth Navy gin, a silky-smooth calvados, bergamot and sparkling wine. If you\u2019ve come straight from supper, the Banana Ramos\u2019s artery-clogging blend of coconut cream, banana milk and J\u00e4germeister makes a perfect pudding \u2013 or keep the night going with a jug of frozen margarita. Absinthe makes a lot of appearances too. Best of all, prices are incredibly affordable \u2013 most cocktails hover around the \u00a39 mark, and there\u2019s a daily happy hour too. \n \n[h3]FOOD[/h3]\nThere isn\u2019t any \u2013 but Fitzrovia\u2019s a foodie hotspot so there\u2019s no shortage of dining options nearby. Hakkasan is literally next door; there\u2019s Ottolenghi\u2019s vegetable- and fermentation-led [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-restaurants-london#NQ2vGbpLpDW\"]Rovi[/link] just up the road and around the corner the larger than life, shiny brand new [link url=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-restaurants-london#9JP9qK3a5V9\"]Circolo Popolare[/link].\n \n[h3]VERDICT[/h3] \nUnpretentious, affordable and fun without feeling gimmicky \u2013 this is the perfect place to go to fill the pre- or post-dinner lag. \n\n[callout]\n[b]Address:[/b] Murder Inc, 36 Hanway Street, Fitzrovia, London W1T 1UP\n[b]Telephone:[/b] +44 20 7427 6097\n[b]Website:[/b] [link url=\"https://www.murderinclondon.com/\"]murderinclondon.com[/link]\n[/callout]",
